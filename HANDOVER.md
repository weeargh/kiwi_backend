# Kiwi3 Project Handover Document

## Testing Architecture Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive testing architecture for the Kiwi3 RSU/ESOP platform that covers multiple levels of testing. This document provides a high-level overview of the testing approach, current implementation status, and recommendations for future development.

### Key Components

1. **Backend Testing (Jest)**
   - **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules in isolation
   - **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with a real test database connection
   - **Mock Implementations**: Custom mocks for Auth0 authentication middleware

2. **Frontend Testing (Cypress)**
   - **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows through the application
   - **Auth0 Integration**: Both UI-based and programmatic authentication approaches
   - **Custom Commands**: Utility functions for common testing tasks

### Implementation Status

#### Completed
- âœ… Backend test architecture with Auth0 middleware mocking
- âœ… Tenant API integration tests
- âœ… Application smoke test
- âœ… Auth0 login test structure
- âœ… Test utilities and helper functions
- âœ… Test database configuration and setup

#### In Progress
- ðŸŸ¡ Additional API endpoint tests (User, Grant, etc.)
- ðŸŸ¡ Complete E2E test coverage for critical user journeys
- ðŸŸ¡ CI/CD integration for automated testing

#### Planned
- â¬œ Performance testing
- â¬œ Security testing
- â¬œ Comprehensive unit test coverage

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Backend Testing

1. **Follow the Established Pattern**:
   - Use the middleware/__mocks__/auth.js approach for Auth0 mocking
   - Place integration tests in __tests__/*.integration.test.js files
   - Use test-utils.js for common functions

2. **Database Considerations**:
   - Always use the test database (kiwi3_test) for integration tests
   - Ensure tests clean up after themselves or use transaction rollbacks

3. **Auth0 Authentication Testing**:
   - The checkJwt.resetToSuccess() and checkJwt.simulateAuthFailure() methods provide a reliable way to test both successful and failed authentication

### Frontend Testing

1. **Auth0 Testing Approaches**:
   - For most tests: Use the cy.loginViaAuth0() custom command
   - For specific login flow tests: Use the auth.cy.js approach with cy.origin()
   - Consider using Auth0's testing guidelines for complex scenarios

2. **Component Testing**:
   - Consider adding component-level tests using Vue Test Utils or similar

3. **Test Data Management**:
   - Use fixtures for consistent test data
   - Consider adding database seeding utilities for E2E tests

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure Docker services are running
   - Verify DB_HOST is set correctly (localhost for host, postgres for container)
   - Check that migrations have been run on the test database

2. **Auth0 Testing Issues**:
   - Use programmatic login where possible to avoid UI-based authentication
   - Ensure cypress.env.json contains the necessary Auth0 credentials
   - Use dedicated test users with appropriate permissions

3. **Jest Not Exiting**:
   - The --forceExit flag has been added to the npm test script
   - Use --detectOpenHandles for troubleshooting

## Documentation Resources

- [TESTS.md](./TESTS.md): Detailed information about the testing setup and implementation
- [README.md](./README.md): Overview of the project, including testing information
- [Auth0-Setup.md](./Auth0-Setup.md): Auth0 configuration for the application

## Next Steps

1. Complete test coverage for all API endpoints
2. Add more E2E tests for critical user journeys
3. Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline
4. Implement performance and security testing
